# Project Name: Cryptocurrency Clustering

![Alt text](10-5-challenge-image.png)

## Project Overview 

The goal of this project is to create a prototype for a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies. This approach will take into account factors beyond just returns and volatility to provide better performance for the portfolio. The project will combine financial Python programming skills with unsupervised learning to create a Jupyter notebook that clusters cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods and visualizes the results.

## Key Features

- Clustering of cryptocurrencies by performance in different time periods
- Visualization of performance results
- Incorporation of additional factors beyond returns and volatility to improve portfolio performance

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Unsupervised learning techniques (e.g. k-means clustering)

## Usage
To use this project, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your local machine. The project utilizes unsupervised learning techniques, so familiarity with these concepts and techniques is recommended.

To run the project, simply open the Jupyter Notebook file and run the cells to generate the clustering and visualization results.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to submit a pull request or reach out to the repository owner with your ideas.

## Future Work
There is room for future expansion and improvement of the project, such as incorporating more factors into the clustering algorithm or improving the visualization results. Contributions from the community are encouraged to help further develop the project.
